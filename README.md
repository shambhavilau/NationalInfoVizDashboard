# NationalInfoVizDashboard
The project's goal is to develop a National Information Visualization Dashboard for India, providing users with access to data on nine key parameters, including 
  - crime rate
  - transportation
  - costs
  - natural catastrophes
  - population
  - resources
  - tourism
  - weather
  - literacy
  
This dashboard aims to offer a clear visual representation of India's demographics, literacy rates, natural disaster status, and more created using Tableau software. It will serve as a centralized information hub for India, enabling users to access data on specific locations, potential risks, demographical information, and predictions related to disasters. The project will involve various stages, including issue statement comprehension, data gathering, preprocessing, data modeling, model assessment, visualization, and presentation to create this informative dashboard.

## The approach:
The process of building the project dataset entails gathering data from primary and secondary sources about various domains, compiling it for further processing, cleaning, pre-processing, formatting, and exploratory data analysis to extract insights from the usable data.

After performing the thorough analysis of the data, visualizations are created. An example of natural disasters visualizations is :

Visulation for Water quality data is as follows:

The impact of a platform is evaluated through its use cases. For this project, the development of a platform that will allow essential data to be observed and predicted would be helpful for a variety of businesses that need a means to understand Indian demographics for their business: With fewer assumptions, their interpretation will be more accurate, which can help with better decision-making based on the real data at hand. They could be able to spot emerging trends and create plans based on them to attain a goal or hasten an organizationâ€™s expansion. By correctly evaluating the data on Indian demographics, many businesses may more effectively manage their resources in line with their demands.

## The development stages:
were Data preprocessing, UI Design completion, Dashboard and Visualization formation, Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithm training and testing, Development of the website and integration with the models and dashboards.

### Machine Learning Model:
The identified domains consist of a vast variety of data collected from various sources. These datasets consist of varying features and have numerous underlying patterns which need to be identified and hence worked upon in order to obtain the desired results. For this purpose, thorough analysis of the entire data repository containing all the collected data was performed and critical information about the problem statements for each domain were identified
Majority of our chosen domains follow the strategy as shown in :

A neural network-based model is proposed for the remaining domains which include Natural Disasters, Earthquake, Landslides and Weather. These datasets contain timestamps which play a crucial role in determining the output parameters for these domains. Therefore, Long Short-Term Memory which is a type of Recurrent Neural Networks is utilized. The proposed architecture for this model

## Results:
The accuracies obtained by the five Machine Learning Regression models applied on the domains of population, literacy, expenses, landslides, crime rate, underground water quality, river water quality, forest cover, tourism and transportation are depicted
